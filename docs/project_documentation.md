### 🌍 Background  
The rapid urbanization of tier-2 cities in India has opened new avenues for mobility services, especially in regions underserved by traditional cab aggregators. Goodcabs, launched just two years ago, has leveraged this gap by focusing exclusively on tier-2 cities, offering affordable and reliable transportation while empowering local drivers. By emphasizing sustainability and community-driven operations, Goodcabs has built a loyal customer base and a reputation for quality service in a market often overlooked by industry giants.

In 2024, Goodcabs aims to scale operations and boost both service efficiency and customer retention. With operations active in 10 tier-2 cities, the company has set performance benchmarks to track growth, passenger satisfaction, and repeat ridership. Bruce Haryali, the Chief of Operations, is eager to assess Goodcabs' current standing and uncover insights to inform strategic decisions. With the analytics manager occupied, the responsibility now falls to Peter Pandey, the company's inquisitive data analyst(me), to lead this critical analysis and prepare a compelling presentation for leadership.
